# item.missing
Use latent class modelling to examine item missing data in surveys using example data from the HABITAT study: https://iha.acu.edu.au/research/research-projects/habitat-project/. 

Details on the methods will hopefully be published in a paper titled "Identifying patterns of item missing survey data using latent groups: an observational study".
