# item.missing
Use latent class modelling to examine item missing data in surveys using example data from the HABITAT study: https://iha.acu.edu.au/research/research-projects/habitat-project/. 

Details on the methods are in our paper "Identifying patterns of item missing survey data using latent groups: an observational study" available here https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/10/e017284.

The file `Rmixmod.habitat.R` uses the data file `Missing.habitat.data.RData` to replicate the results in the paper.
